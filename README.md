# StockInsightAI2024 📈

**StockInsightAI2024** is a stock market prediction app that uses **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks to forecast stock prices. The app provides users with stock price predictions, moving averages, and interactive charts for better decision-making in stock trading.

## 🌟 Inspiration

I was always intrigued by the stock market's unpredictable nature and wanted to create a tool that could help make sense of the chaos. By combining my passion for data science and the financial world, I set out to build an app that offers stock price predictions, hoping to make stock trading more data-driven.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Stock Price Prediction**: Predict future stock prices using LSTM models trained on historical data.
- **Moving Averages**: Gain insights into stock trends with **50-day**, **100-day**, and **200-day** moving averages.
- **Interactive Charts**: Visualize historical and predicted stock prices with dynamic charts.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easily input stock symbols and retrieve predictions through an intuitive Streamlit interface.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **LSTM Model**: The LSTM neural network is trained on historical stock price data fetched using **yFinance**.
2. **Data Visualization**: Predictions and historical prices are plotted using **Matplotlib** for easy comparison.
3. **Moving Averages**: Calculate 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages to identify stock trends.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python, Keras, TensorFlow
- **Data Fetching**: yFinance
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib
- **Model**: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
